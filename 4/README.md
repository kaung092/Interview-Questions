4) You have ten thousand strings of data separated by new lines \n in a text document. Contained within each string in no particular order is the following separated by whitespace:
A first and last name
A phone number
An email
A street address, including a numeric address number, street/avenue name, city and zip

Use php to Make a script which parses the file and separates the above fields from each row, storing them in a SQLite database. I have included an attachment with some sample data that you can use as a test to parse against.
